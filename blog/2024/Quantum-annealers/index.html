While they leverage quantum effects, they differ fundamentally from gate-based, universal quantum computers (like Google’s Sycamore or IBM’s quantum processors). Here’s why quantum annealers are not typically considered “real” or <em>universal</em> quantum computers:</p> <hr> <h3 id="1-limited-quantum-operations">1. <strong>Limited Quantum Operations</strong> </h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Quantum annealers</strong> are specialized machines that use quantum effects (superposition, tunneling, and entanglement) to find the ground state of a physical system.</li> <li>In contrast, <strong>universal quantum computers</strong> are programmable to perform a wide range of quantum algorithms using sequences of quantum gates.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Key Difference</strong>: Annealers cannot execute general quantum operations or algorithms like Shor’s algorithm or Grover’s algorithm because they lack gate-based logic.</p> <hr> <h3 id="2-no-quantum-circuit-model">2. <strong>No Quantum Circuit Model</strong> </h3> <ul> <li>Universal quantum computers operate using the <strong>quantum circuit model</strong>, where qubits are manipulated using a sequence of quantum gates.

They are designed to solve specific optimization problems by finding the global minimum (lowest energy configuration) of a given system. Below, I’ll break it down with a simple explanation and a step-by-step example.</p> <hr> <h2 id="how-quantum-annealers-work"><strong>How Quantum Annealers Work</strong></h2> <h3 id="1-problem-representation-as-an-energy-landscape"><strong>1. Problem Representation as an Energy Landscape</strong></h3> <p>To use a quantum annealer, an optimization problem must be reformulated into a form that corresponds to a <strong>quantum energy landscape</strong>. This typically involves representing the problem using an <strong>Ising model</strong> or a <strong>QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)</strong> formulation.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Ising Model</strong>: The problem is mapped to a system of interacting <strong>spins</strong> with two states, \(+1\) (up) and \(-1\) (down).

The couplers tune the interactions between qubits, effectively reshaping the energy landscape, and quantum tunneling arises as part of this <strong>adiabatic evolution</strong>. Here is a detailed explanation:</p> <hr> <h2 id="1-basics-of-quantum-tunneling"><strong>1. Basics of Quantum Tunneling</strong></h2> <p>In classical systems, a particle trapped in a potential well (a local minimum of energy) cannot overcome a barrier unless it has enough energy. However, in quantum mechanics, due to the <strong>wave-like nature of particles</strong>, there is a nonzero probability that the particle will “tunnel” through the barrier and appear on the other side. This phenomenon is known as <strong>quantum tunneling</strong>.</p> <h3 id="in-the-context-of-a-quantum-annealer">In the context of a quantum annealer:</h3> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>The qubits represent a quantum state that can exist in a superposition of $$</td> <td>0\rangle\(and\)</td> <td>1\rangle$$ states.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The system evolves slowly enough that tunneling between different quantum states (e.g., from one local minimum to another) can occur.</p> <p>This helps the system escape local minima and potentially reach the global minimum.</p> <hr> <h2 id="2-role-of-couplers-in-quantum-annealing"><strong>2. Role of Couplers in Quantum Annealing</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>couplers</strong> in a quantum annealer control the interaction strengths between qubits. By tuning the couplers, the system’s energy landscape is gradually adjusted, which directly influences the probability of tunneling. Here’s how it works:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Initial Hamiltonian</strong>:<br> At the beginning of the annealing process, the system is governed by a simple Hamiltonian (e.g., a transverse field Hamiltonian): \(H_{initial} = - \sum_i \Delta \sigma_i^x\) \(\Delta\) is the strength of the transverse field (driving quantum tunneling).</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>\(\sigma_i^x\) is the Pauli-X operator, which flips qubit states between $$</td> <td>0\rangle\(and\)</td> <td>1\rangle$$.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>In this regime:</p> <p>The transverse field dominates, and the qubits exist in a <strong>superposition</strong> of \(|0 \rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). The couplers are initially weak or inactive, so qubits interact minimally with one another.</p> </li> <li> <strong>Tuning the Couplers and Reducing the Transverse Field</strong>:<br> During the annealing process: <ul> <li>The transverse field \(\Delta\) is gradually turned off (reduced to zero), weakening the qubits’ tendency to remain in superposition.</li> <li>Simultaneously, the <strong>couplers</strong> are tuned to introduce and strengthen interactions between qubits. This gradually imposes the <strong>problem Hamiltonian</strong>: \(H_{final} = \sum_i h_i \sigma_i^z + \sum_{i &lt; j} J_{ij} \sigma_i^z \sigma_j^z\)</li> </ul> <p>\(h_i\) represents local biases (single-qubit contributions to the energy). \(J_{ij}\) represents the coupling strength between qubits \(i\) and \(j\). \(\sigma_i^z\) is the Pauli-Z operator, which measures qubits’ states as \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\).</p> </li> <li> <strong>Tunneling During Evolution</strong>:<br> As the transverse field weakens and couplers define the problem’s energy landscape: <ul> <li>The system transitions from a state dominated by superposition to one that encodes the optimization problem.</li> <li> <strong>Quantum tunneling</strong> occurs when qubits “tunnel” through energy barriers between local minima. Instead of climbing over barriers (as in classical systems), the quantum state tunnels to lower-energy configurations.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Final State</strong>:<br> At the end of the annealing process: <ul> <li>The transverse field is turned off entirely.</li> <li>The couplers fully encode the problem’s constraints and interactions.</li> <li>The system settles into its <strong>ground state</strong> (lowest energy state), which corresponds to the optimal solution.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <hr> <h2 id="how-tuning-the-couplers-affects-tunneling"><strong>How Tuning the Couplers Affects Tunneling</strong></h2> <p>The couplers’ role in tuning the interaction strengths \(J_{ij}\) between qubits directly shapes the energy landscape of the problem:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Weak Couplings</strong>: <ul> <li>When the couplers are weak, the energy landscape is relatively “flat,” and tunneling is widespread because the barriers between states are low.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Strong Couplings</strong>: <ul> <li>As the couplers are strengthened, the energy barriers between local minima grow, and the system begins to “lock in” on specific energy configurations.</li> <li>However, tunneling still occurs if the barriers are not too large, helping the system escape local minima and reach the global minimum.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>By controlling the couplers and transverse field during the annealing process, the system balances <strong>exploration</strong> (via tunneling) and <strong>exploitation</strong> (converging toward the ground state).</p> <hr> <h2 id="visualization-a-simple-energy-landscape"><strong>Visualization: A Simple Energy Landscape</strong></h2> <p>Imagine a quantum annealer working on a problem with two qubits and two potential states:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>State A</strong> (local minimum): Higher energy, but nearby.</li> <li> <strong>State B</strong> (global minimum): Lower energy, but separated by an energy barrier.</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Initially, the transverse field dominates, and the system is in a superposition of both states.</li> <li>As the couplers strengthen and the transverse field reduces, the energy landscape forms a “valley” with an energy barrier between State A and State B.</li> <li> <strong>Quantum tunneling</strong> allows the system to tunnel through the energy barrier and reach State B (the global minimum), even though it would be “classically” stuck in State A.</li> </ol> <hr> <h2 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h2> <ul> <li>Quantum tunneling happens as the couplers reshape the energy landscape during the annealing process.</li> <li>Initially, qubits exist in superposition, with a transverse field promoting tunneling.</li> <li>Gradual tuning of couplers strengthens qubit interactions and reshapes the landscape to reflect the problem.</li> <li>Quantum tunneling helps the system escape local minima and find the global minimum efficiently.</li> </ul> <p>By carefully managing the evolution of the couplers and transverse field, quantum annealers exploit quantum tunneling to solve complex optimization problems.</p> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Chunde Huang.
