I have taught undergraduate physics labs for Physics 201 and 202 at Washington State University for several years, where I was regarded by students as one of their favorite teaching assistants. I enjoyed sharing my knowledge and experiences in physics with younger students, encouraging them to pursue excellence in science.

## Physics 201
Physics 201 at Washington State University is a calculus-based course titled **Physics for Scientists and Engineers I**. It covers a range of fundamental topics including mechanics, vibrations and waves, and thermodynamics². The course is designed to help students understand the principles of motion, energy, and the behavior of materials and fluids.

### Key Details:
- **Prerequisites**: MATH 171 with a grade of C or better, or concurrent enrollment in MATH 172 or higher³.
- **Topics Covered**: Kinematics, dynamics, rotational motion, waves and oscillations, fluids, and thermodynamics².
- **Instructor**: Prof. Gary S. Collins (for one of the sections)².
- **Textbook**: *Physics for Scientists and Engineers: A Strategic Approach* by Randall Knight².

## Physics 202
Physics 202 at Washington State University (WSU) is a calculus-based course titled **Physics for Scientists and Engineers II**. It primarily covers topics in electricity, magnetism, electromagnetics, DC and AC circuits, and optics¹³. 

The course includes detailed lectures on:
- **Electrostatics**: Electric charge, Coulomb’s law, electric fields, Gauss’s law, electric potential energy, and electric potential.
- **Magnetostatics and Electromagnetism**: Magnetism, electric current, Ampere’s force law, Biot–Savart law, Gauss’s law for magnetism, Ampere’s law, Lorentz force law, relativity of fields, electromagnetic induction, and Maxwell's equations.
- **Electrical Circuits**: Electrical networks, Kirchhoff’s laws, wires, batteries, resistors, capacitors, inductors, and various types of circuits (RC, RL, AC, LC).
- **Waves and Optics**: Wave equation, solutions to the wave equation, superposition, waves in multiple dimensions, wave optics, and geometrical optics¹.
