I hold a Ph.D. in Physics with a specialization in experimental research on fundamental quantum gases. This challenging and dynamic field provides me with the comprehensive knowledge and experimental skills required to delve into the mysteries of nature. My research centers on the fundamental principles of superfluidity and superconductivity across various temperatures.

Quantum physics has been a lifelong passion, one to which I have dedicated years of study, mastering its core principles and exploring the intricate physical world it describes. Through rigorous research, I have developed expertise in conducting advanced quantum experiments, including building and operating sophisticated devices—circuitry, lasers, and optical spectrometers—alongside performing hyperfine spectroscopy to trap, cool, manipulate, and probe atomic quantum states.

In addition to my physics background, I am an experienced software engineer with a strong grounding in engineering principles. This dual expertise empowers me to design and implement complex software systems. My computer science interests, particularly in computer vision and machine learning, have led me to develop a range of research tools for the scientific community. These skills are instrumental for running simulations and building essential software that advances my research and contributes to the broader field.
