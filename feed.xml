The cytoplasm‚Äôs elasticity allows the organism to extend its neck in different directions.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Microtubules</strong>: The neck contains microtubules, which are part of the cytoskeleton. These microtubules provide structural support and are crucial for the extension and retraction of the neck. They guide the movement of the cytoplasm, ensuring that the neck can be controlled accurately.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Cilia</strong>: The organism is covered in cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures that help in movement and feeding. Cilia around the neck assist in directing food particles towards the mouth region (cytostome).</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id="behavioral-mechanisms">Behavioral Mechanisms:</h3> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Seeking Food</strong>: Lacrymaria olor moves its neck in a searching pattern, extending it in various directions to explore its environment. This movement increases the chance of encountering prey or food particles.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Prey Capture</strong>: When the neck makes contact with food, it wraps around the particle and retracts, pulling the prey toward the main body. The food is then engulfed through phagocytosis at the cytostome.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Sensory Response</strong>: The organism‚Äôs movement and extension are partially controlled by chemical signals. Lacrymaria olor can sense the presence of food through chemical cues in the water and direct its neck towards the source.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Overall, the ability of Lacrymaria olor to extend its neck and capture food is a fascinating example of how single-celled organisms can exhibit complex behaviors and structural adaptations to survive in their microscopic environments.</p> <iframe width="720" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sq6Y54mxjOg?si=173Jb7XProjuKXuZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="Biology"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[this is what included tabs in a post could look like]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Using Isaac Sim with ROS2</title><link href="https://chunde.github.io/blog/2025/Isaac-With-ROS2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Using Isaac Sim with ROS2"/><published>2025-01-04T05:42:34+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-04T05:42:34+00:00</updated><id>https://chunde.github.io/blog/2025/Isaac-With-ROS2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://chunde.github.io/blog/2025/Isaac-With-ROS2/"><![CDATA[<p>Here is a very helpful video that guide me through many features of Isaac Sim.

Basics of Quantum Tunneling</strong></h2> <p>In classical systems, a particle trapped in a potential well (a local minimum of energy) cannot overcome a barrier unless it has enough energy.

Role of Couplers in Quantum Annealing</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>couplers</strong> in a quantum annealer control the interaction strengths between qubits. By tuning the couplers, the system‚Äôs energy landscape is gradually adjusted, which directly influences the probability of tunneling. Here‚Äôs how it works:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Initial Hamiltonian</strong>:<br/> At the beginning of the annealing process, the system is governed by a simple Hamiltonian (e.g., a transverse field Hamiltonian): \(H_{initial} = - \sum_i \Delta \sigma_i^x\) \(\Delta\) is the strength of the transverse field (driving quantum tunneling).</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>\(\sigma_i^x\) is the Pauli-X operator, which flips qubit states between $$</td> <td>0\rangle\(and\)</td> <td>1\rangle$$.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>In this regime:</p> <p>The transverse field dominates, and the qubits exist in a <strong>superposition</strong> of \(|0 \rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). The couplers are initially weak or inactive, so qubits interact minimally with one another.</p> </li> <li><strong>Tuning the Couplers and Reducing the Transverse Field</strong>:<br/> During the annealing process: <ul> <li>The transverse field \(\Delta\) is gradually turned off (reduced to zero), weakening the qubits‚Äô tendency to remain in superposition.</li> <li>Simultaneously, the <strong>couplers</strong> are tuned to introduce and strengthen interactions between qubits. This gradually imposes the <strong>problem Hamiltonian</strong>: \(H_{final} = \sum_i h_i \sigma_i^z + \sum_{i &lt; j} J_{ij} \sigma_i^z \sigma_j^z\)</li> </ul> <p>\(h_i\) represents local biases (single-qubit contributions to the energy). \(J_{ij}\) represents the coupling strength between qubits \(i\) and \(j\). \(\sigma_i^z\) is the Pauli-Z operator, which measures qubits‚Äô states as \(|0\rangle\) or \(|1\rangle\).</p> </li> <li><strong>Tunneling During Evolution</strong>:<br/> As the transverse field weakens and couplers define the problem‚Äôs energy landscape: <ul> <li>The system transitions from a state dominated by superposition to one that encodes the optimization problem.</li> <li><strong>Quantum tunneling</strong> occurs when qubits ‚Äútunnel‚Äù through energy barriers between local minima.

Unlike forces directly associated with electromagnetic fields (e.g., Lorentz force), the ponderomotive force arises due to spatial variations in the intensity of the oscillating field.</p> <h3 id="key-features-of-ponderomotive-force">Key Features of Ponderomotive Force:</h3> <ol> <li><strong>Nature</strong>: <ul> <li>It is time-averaged, meaning it acts over the period of oscillation of the electromagnetic field.</li> <li>It is a repulsive force, pushing particles away from regions of higher field intensity.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Expression</strong>: <ul> <li>For a charged particle of mass \(m\) and charge \(q\), the ponderomotive force \(F_p\) is given by:</li> <li> \[F_p = -\frac{q^2}{4m\omega^2} \nabla |E|^2\] </li> </ul> <p>where:</p> <ul> <li>\(E\) is the electric field strength,</li> <li>\(\omega\) is the angular frequency of the oscillating field,</li> <li>\(\nabla E^2\) represents the gradient of the field intensity.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Mechanism</strong>: <ul> <li>The oscillatory motion caused by the electric field is slightly stronger in regions of higher intensity. This imbalance results in a net drift of the particle away from those regions.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Applications</strong>: <ul> <li><strong>Laser-plasma interactions</strong>: Plays a role in laser-driven acceleration of particles.</li> <li><strong>Trapping and guiding</strong>: Used in optical traps and the manipulation of particles.</li> <li><strong>Astrophysics</strong>: Relevant in analyzing particle behavior in varying electromagnetic fields in space.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h3 id="intuition">Intuition:</h3> <p>The ponderomotive force can be thought of as a ‚Äúpressure‚Äù exerted by an oscillating electromagnetic field on charged particles, driving them toward regions of lower field intensity.</p> <p>The term <strong>‚Äúponderomotive‚Äù</strong> comes from the Latin root <em>pondero</em>, meaning ‚Äúto weigh‚Äù or ‚Äúto consider,‚Äù reflecting the concept of a force that results from the cumulative effect of oscillating fields on charged particles. Here‚Äôs how it relates to the <strong>ponderomotive force</strong>:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Averaging Effect</strong>:<br/> The ponderomotive force does not act instantaneously with the oscillating electric field but is the result of the <em>time-averaged effect</em> of these oscillations. The oscillations ‚Äúponder‚Äù (consider, weigh) over time to produce a net force.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Directional Behavior</strong>:<br/> The force moves particles away from regions of high electromagnetic field intensity, as if ‚Äúconsidering‚Äù or ‚Äúweighing‚Äù the field‚Äôs spatial variations.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Energy Interpretation</strong>:<br/> The word ponderomotive suggests a relationship with the energy gradient. The force arises from the need to balance the energy density across regions of the electromagnetic field, similar to how pressure gradients drive fluid motion.</p> </li> </ol> <h3 id="in-context">In Context:</h3> <p>The <strong>ponderomotive force</strong> is not about direct action but about how particles ‚Äúsense‚Äù the overall structure of the field through the oscillatory motion.
