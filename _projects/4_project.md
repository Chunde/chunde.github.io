NASA’s Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL) is the first atomic physics experiment to be conducted aboard the International Space Station, benefiting from a unique microgravity environment. This setup allows scientists to observe atomic phenomena with unprecedented clarity, such as attempting to detect the first excited Efimov state without excessive atom loss. Microgravity enables the use of advanced cooling techniques, including delta-kick cooling, which would be difficult to achieve on Earth.
I was tasked with simulating this cooling technique using a microchip designed to generate magnetic fields. My research focused on identifying the optimal current configuration for maximizing cooling efficiency, an essential factor for successful experimental outcomes in CAL.
