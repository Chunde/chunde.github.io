## Introduction

This is one of my implementations of ViBe background Model which can process each frame in around 10ms( not include the time for the CCD to capture the image) or less. ViBe model can be used in foreground object detection and tracking, and it works pretty well based on my test.

NOTE: The ViBe is protected by several patents, if you need to use it, please contact the author to get licensing, the inventor has a better version and they are very helpful.
