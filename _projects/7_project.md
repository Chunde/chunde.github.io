This project was my first foray into computer vision. I independently designed and implemented all the algorithms, such as FFT and Adaboost. The associated software features a sleek UI and delivers real-time performance, thanks to a well-designed tech stack and solid software engineering principles. This project also earned second prize in a national academic contest.
