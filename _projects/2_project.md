I developed an optical system for a lithium Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) experiment, focusing on laser cooling, repumping, imaging, and implementing a push beam for creating a 2D Mott insulator. To achieve this, I constructed a lithium spectroscope to identify the precise transition absorption line at 671 nm. This line, which I pinpointed using the principle of saturated absorption spectroscopy, was critical for addressing the Doppler broadening effect and ensuring the accuracy of laser-based interactions with lithium atoms. I then designed and assembled a laser system, integrating a laser diode with a grating for precise wavelength tuning. By resolving mode-hopping and other engineering challenges, I secured the systemâ€™s stability and performance, essential for maintaining the laser frequencies required for all experimental stages.
