Deep Q-Learning (DQL) is a temporal difference method used to estimate an action-value function. Rather than estimating the real-valued prediction for every possible state-action pair, we propose an alternative approach that involves learning a probabilistic model of the transition function. Specifically, we employ a convolutional network trained on 4-tuples (state, action, reward, and next state). Instead of directly learning an action-value function, this network learns to predict the next state and reward based on a given state-action input. This model-based approach enables integration of planning, reducing the amount of real-world data required, though it demands greater computational resources during training.
My interest in this area was sparked by Google's DeepMind achievement with Atari, which I found truly inspiring. At the time I was developing this project, my knowledge of reinforcement learning was limited. To gain a deeper understanding of DQN, I began by studying and debugging Pac-Man code to grasp its core principles. Following this, I explored the source code of DeepMindâ€™s Atari framework and successfully replicated their results on the "Breakout" game, as described in their Nature paper. After training the DQN network for approximately 12 million steps, I achieved my expected outcomes and continued to explore the LUA source code, eventually gaining a comprehensive understanding of the implementation details.
I also experimented with transferring parameters from a trained network to a new game to accelerate training. This approach provided valuable insights into optimizing training processes across tasks.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
