Let's derive the edge states for a simple model: the **Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model**. The SSH model is a one-dimensional lattice model that exhibits topological properties and edge states. It's a great starting point to understand how edge states emerge in topological systems.

### **1. The SSH Model**
The SSH model describes electrons hopping on a 1D chain with alternating hopping amplitudes $$ t_1 $$ and $$ t_2 $$. The Hamiltonian is:

$$
H = \sum_{i} \left( t_1 c_{A,i}^\dagger c_{B,i} + t_2 c_{B,i}^\dagger c_{A,i+1} + \text{h.c.} \right),
$$

where:
- $$ c_{A,i}^\dagger $$ and $$ c_{B,i}^\dagger $$ create electrons on sublattices $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ at site $$ i $$,
- $$ t_1 $$ and $$ t_2 $$ are the intra-cell and inter-cell hopping amplitudes, respectively.

### **2. Bulk Hamiltonian in Momentum Space**
To study the bulk properties, we Fourier transform the Hamiltonian into momentum space. Define the Fourier transforms:

$$
c_{A,i} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_k e^{ik \cdot i} c_{A,k}, \quad c_{B,i} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_k e^{ik \cdot i} c_{B,k},
$$

where $$ N $$ is the number of unit cells, and $$ k $$ is the crystal momentum. The Hamiltonian becomes:

$$
H = \sum_k \begin{pmatrix} c_{A,k}^\dagger & c_{B,k}^\dagger \end{pmatrix} H(k) \begin{pmatrix} c_{A,k} \\ c_{B,k} \end{pmatrix},
$$

where the bulk Hamiltonian $$ H(k) $$ is:

$$
H(k) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & t_1 + t_2 e^{-ik} \\
t_1 + t_2 e^{ik} & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

This can be written as:

$$
H(k) = \vec{d}(k) \cdot \vec{\sigma},
$$

where $$ \vec{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) $$ are the Pauli matrices, and:

$$
\vec{d}(k) = (t_1 + t_2 \cos k, \, t_2 \sin k, \, 0).
$$

### **3. Topological Invariant**
The SSH model is characterized by a topological invariant called the **winding number** $$ W $$, which is defined as:

$$
W = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} dk \, \frac{d\phi(k)}{dk},
$$

where $$ \phi(k) = \arg(d_x(k) + i d_y(k)) $$. For the SSH model:
If $$|t_1| < |t_2|$$, $$ W = 1 $$ (topologically non-trivial).
If $$|t_1| > |t_2|$$, $$ W = 0 $$ (topologically trivial).

### **4. Edge States in the Topological Phase**
When $$ |t_1| < |t_2| $$, the system is in the topological phase, and edge states appear at the boundaries of a finite chain. Let's derive these edge states.

#### **Finite Chain with Open Boundary Conditions**
Consider a finite chain with $$ N $$ unit cells and open boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian is:

$$
H = \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \left( t_1 c_{A,i}^\dagger c_{B,i} + t_2 c_{B,i}^\dagger c_{A,i+1} + \text{h.c.} \right).
$$

We look for zero-energy eigenstates 

$$|\psi \rangle = \sum_i (\psi_{A,i} c_{A,i}^\dagger + \psi_{B,i} c_{B,i}^\dagger) |0\rangle $$ 

that satisfy 

$$ 
H|\psi \rangle = 0 
$$

#### **Recursion Relations**
From the SchrÃ¶dinger equation $$ H|\psi \rangle = 0 $$, we get the recursion relations:
$$
t_1 \psi_{B,i} + t_2 \psi_{B,i-1} = 0, \quad t_1 \psi_{A,i} + t_2 \psi_{A,i+1} = 0.
$$

Assume an exponential ansatz for the wavefunctions:

$$
\psi_{A,i} = \alpha^i, \quad \psi_{B,i} = \beta^i.
$$

Substituting into the recursion relations, we get:

$$
t_1 \beta^i + t_2 \beta^{i-1} = 0 \implies t_1 \beta + t_2 = 0 \implies \beta = -\frac{t_2}{t_1},
$$

$$
t_1 \alpha^i + t_2 \alpha^{i+1} = 0 \implies t_1 + t_2 \alpha = 0 \implies \alpha = -\frac{t_1}{t_2}.
$$

#### **Localization of Edge States**
For $$ |t_1| < |t_2| $$, $$ |\alpha| < 1 $$ and $$ |\beta| > 1 $$. This means:
 $$ \psi_{A,i} $$ decays exponentially from the left edge ($$ i = 1 $$).
 $$ \psi_{B,i} $$ decays exponentially from the right edge ($$ i = N $$).

Thus, the edge states are localized at the ends of the chain.

---

### **5. Summary**
 The SSH model exhibits edge states in the topological phase $$ |t_1| < |t_2| $$.
- These edge states are zero-energy modes localized at the ends of the chain.
- The existence of edge states is protected by the topological invariant (winding number).

This derivation illustrates how edge states emerge in a simple topological system. Similar principles apply to more complex models like 2D topological insulators and quantum Hall systems.
