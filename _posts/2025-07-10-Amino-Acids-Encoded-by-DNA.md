Below is the complete list of the **20 standard amino acids** that can be expressed by DNA sequences, along with their corresponding **DNA codons** (using the standard genetic code). Each entry includes a link to its Wikipedia page for further details.

### Notes:  
1. **Stop codons** (TAA, TAG, TGA) are not included as they do not encode amino acids.  
2. The table follows the **universal genetic code** (some organisms may have minor variations).  
3. Methionine (ATG) also serves as the **initiation codon** in most proteins.
