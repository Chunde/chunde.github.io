Sodium fluorescein guided microscopy is a biomedical imaging technique that utilizes the fluorescent dye sodium fluorescein to improve the visualization of biological tissues, cellular structures, or pathological features under a microscope. Sodium fluorescein (chemical formula $$C_{20}H_{10}Na_2O_5$$) is a water-soluble, yellow-green fluorescent compound that emits light at approximately 521 nm when excited by blue light (around 494 nm). This property makes it highly effective for highlighting specific areas of interest in various applications, such as ophthalmology, dermatology, and surgical procedures.

The process typically involves applying sodium fluorescein topically, intravenously, or via other routes, depending on the target tissue. Under a fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filters (e.g., a blue excitation filter and a barrier filter to block unwanted wavelengths), the dye-bound regions emit bright green fluorescence, contrasting sharply with the background. This enhances the detection of abnormalities like corneal abrasions, vascular leaks, or tumor margins.

Advantages include high sensitivity, real-time imaging, and relatively low toxicity, though precautions are necessary to avoid adverse reactions. It is widely used in procedures such as fluorescein angiography for retinal imaging and in guided biopsies for cancer diagnosis.
