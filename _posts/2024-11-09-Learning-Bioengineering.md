To prepare for advanced work in biological engineering and bridge your physics and computational background with biological sciences, focusing on a few core areas can be incredibly helpful. Here’s a list of commonly used textbooks that I could self-study in foundational courses:

### 1. **Cell and Molecular Biology**
   - **"Molecular Biology of the Cell"** by Bruce Alberts et al.  
     This is a comprehensive text covering the principles of cell structure, function, and molecular biology. It’s widely used for understanding cellular mechanisms and molecular processes.

   - **"Essential Cell Biology"** by Bruce Alberts et al.  
     A more accessible version of the previous book, this text simplifies many complex ideas, providing a clearer overview if you're just starting with cell biology concepts.

   - **"Molecular Cell Biology"** by Harvey Lodish et al.  
     This book emphasizes molecular processes and gene regulation with an integrated approach, covering the bridge between cell biology and genetics.

### 2. **Genetics and Genomics**
   - **"Introduction to Genetic Analysis"** by Anthony J.F. Griffiths et al.  
     This text covers core genetics principles, from Mendelian genetics to modern molecular genetics. It also touches on genomics, which is essential for understanding CRISPR and other gene-editing techniques.

   - **"Genomes"** by T.A. Brown  
     A practical book that delves into genome structure, function, and bioinformatics, it can be a good reference for understanding how genetics connects to larger biological systems.

### 3. **Biochemistry**
   - **"Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry"** by David L. Nelson and Michael M. Cox  
     A foundational book for biochemistry, it covers metabolism, protein structure, and enzyme kinetics, all of which are essential for biological engineering and cellular reprogramming studies.

   - **"Biochemistry"** by Jeremy M. Berg, John L. Tymoczko, and Lubert Stryer  
     Known for clear explanations, this book delves into the chemistry of life, with practical applications relevant to biomedical research and molecular biology.

### 4. **Bioengineering and Synthetic Biology**
   - **"Biodesign: The Process of Innovating Medical Technologies"** by Paul G. Yock et al.  
     This book provides a framework for applying engineering principles to biological and medical innovations, focusing on problem-solving and the design process.

   - **"Molecular Biotechnology: Principles and Applications of Recombinant DNA"** by Bernard Glick, Jack Pasternak, and Cheryl Patten  
     Covering essential techniques in biotechnology, this text provides insights into gene editing, recombinant DNA, and protein expression.

### 5. **Systems and Computational Biology**
   - **"Systems Biology: A Textbook"** by Edda Klipp et al.  
     A useful text for understanding the modeling and simulation of complex biological systems, integrating cellular and molecular biology with computational approaches.

   - **"Biological Physics: Energy, Information, Life"** by Philip Nelson  
     This book explores the physical principles underlying biological systems, giving you insight into the physics-biology interface and the applications of statistical mechanics to molecular biology.

   - **"Computational Biology: A Practical Introduction to BioData Processing and Analysis"** by Röbbe Wünschiers  
     A hands-on book that provides practical skills in bioinformatics and computational analysis, which will be crucial in fields like genomics and proteomics.

### 6. **Advanced Topics in Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine**
   - **"Stem Cells: An Insider's Guide"** by Paul Knoepfler  
     An accessible book for understanding the potential and applications of stem cells, including ethical considerations.

   - **"Principles of Regenerative Medicine"** by Anthony Atala et al.  
     This book provides a comprehensive overview of regenerative medicine applications, integrating stem cell research with practical therapies.

Each of these books represents a core area of study relevant to your interests in biological engineering. Supplementing this study with recent journal articles in bioengineering, computational biology, and biophysics will keep you updated on cutting-edge techniques and discoveries.
