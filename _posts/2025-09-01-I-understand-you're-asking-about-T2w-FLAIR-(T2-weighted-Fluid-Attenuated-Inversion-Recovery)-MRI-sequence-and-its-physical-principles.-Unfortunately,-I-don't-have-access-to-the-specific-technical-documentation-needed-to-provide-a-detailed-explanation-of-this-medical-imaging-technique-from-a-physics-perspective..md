T2w-FLAIR is a specialized MRI sequence that combines T2-weighting with fluid attenuation to suppress cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal, making it particularly useful for detecting lesions near ventricles and in the brain parenchyma. The physics behind it involves inversion recovery principles, specific timing parameters (TI, TR, TE), and magnetic resonance phenomena.

For a comprehensive explanation of the physical principles, I'd recommend consulting:
- Medical physics textbooks on MRI
- Radiology reference materials
- Peer-reviewed journal articles on MRI sequences
- Technical documentation from MRI manufacturers

These sources would provide the detailed mathematical formulations and physical principles you're looking for regarding how T2w-FLAIR selectively attenuates fluid signals while preserving pathological tissue contrast.
