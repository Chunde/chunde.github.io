FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ that is based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be fast to code, with high performance, and to provide automatic interactive API documentation.

Key features of FastAPI include:
- **High performance**: Built on Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts, it is one of the fastest Python frameworks available, comparable to Node.js and Go.
- **Automatic documentation**: Generates interactive API documentation (using Swagger UI and ReDoc) automatically from your code, making it easy to test and understand endpoints.
- **Type safety**: Leverages Python type hints to validate data, serialize and deserialize inputs and outputs, reducing bugs and improving developer productivity.
- **Asynchronous support**: Native support for async and await, making it efficient for handling high levels of concurrency with ASGI.
- **Dependency injection**: Built-in support for dependency injection, simplifying code organization and reuse.

Example of a simple FastAPI endpoint:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

This code creates a basic API that returns a JSON response. FastAPI automatically generates docs at `/docs` and `/redoc`.

Overall, FastAPI is ideal for developing RESTful APIs, microservices, and other web services where speed, ease of use, and robustness are priorities.
