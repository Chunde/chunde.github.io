Here's a comprehensive table of solar system planets ordered by their distance from the Sun:

| Planet      | Distance from Sun (AU) | Diameter (km) | Mass (Earth=1) | Orbital Period (Earth days) | Rotation Period (Earth days) | Number of Moons | Notable Features |
|-------------|-----------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Mercury     | 0.39                  | 4,880        | 0.055          | 88                         | 58.6                        | 0               | Extreme temperature variations |
| Venus       | 0.72                  | 12,104       | 0.815          | 225                        | 243 (retrograde)            | 0               | Thick CO₂ atmosphere |
| Earth       | 1.00                  | 12,742       | 1.000          | 365.25                     | 1                           | 1               | Only known life-bearing planet |
| Mars        | 1.52                  | 6,779        | 0.107          | 687                        | 1.03                        | 2               | Largest volcano (Olympus Mons) |
| Jupiter     | 5.20                  | 139,822      | 317.8          | 4,333                      | 0.41                        | 95              | Largest planet, Great Red Spot |
| Saturn      | 9.58                  | 116,464      | 95.2           | 10,759                     | 0.45                        | 146             | Prominent ring system |
| Uranus      | 19.22                 | 50,724       | 14.5           | 30,687                     | 0.72 (retrograde)           | 28              | Extreme axial tilt (98°) |
| Neptune     | 30.05                 | 49,244       | 17.1           | 60,190                     | 0.67                        | 16              | Strongest winds in solar system |

Key notes:
1. AU (Astronomical Unit) = average Earth-Sun distance ≈ 149.6 million km
2. Moon counts are as of 2025 (particularly variable for gas giants as new moons are discovered)
3. Rotation periods are sidereal (relative to stars)
4. Dwarf planets (Pluto, Ceres, etc.) are not included in this table

The table shows how planetary characteristics change with distance from the Sun, from the small, rocky inner planets to the massive gas giants of the outer solar system.
