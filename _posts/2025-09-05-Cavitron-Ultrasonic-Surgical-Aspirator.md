The Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) is a sophisticated medical device used in surgery to selectively fragment and remove tissues with high precision, while minimizing damage to surrounding structures. It employs ultrasonic vibrations—typically at frequencies around $$23 \text{kHz}$$ to $$36 \text{kHz}$$—generated by a piezoelectric or magnetostrictive transducer. These vibrations are transmitted to a titanium tip, which oscillates longitudinally at amplitudes on the order of micrometers.

When the tip contacts tissue, the ultrasonic energy causes cavitation and mechanical disruption, effectively emulsifying or fragmenting the target material (e.g., soft tumors, necrotic tissue, or parenchyma). Simultaneously, an integrated irrigation and aspiration system flushes the area with saline and suctions away the debris, keeping the surgical field clear. The device allows surgeons to control parameters such as amplitude (power), aspiration strength, and irrigation rate, tailoring the effect to tissue consistency—softer tissues are more readily fragmented than firmer, collagen-rich ones.

CUSA is particularly valued in neurosurgery for resecting brain tumors (e.g., gliomas or meningiomas) where precision is critical to spare healthy neural tissue, and in hepatic, pancreatic, or other oncologic surgeries for debulking masses. Advantages include reduced bleeding, enhanced visualization, and selective tissue removal, though it requires skill to avoid inadvertent injury. It represents a key tool in minimally invasive and delicate surgical procedures.
