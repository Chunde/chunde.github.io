### Key Concepts
1. **Gapped System**: A quantum system where the ground state is separated from excited states by a finite energy gap $$\Delta > 0$$.
2. **Area Law**: In 1D gapped systems, entanglement entropy typically satisfies $$S \sim \text{constant}$$ (rather than scaling with system size).

### Discrete Example: Spin-1/2 Chain with Nearest-Neighbor Coupling
Consider a 4-site spin chain with Hamiltonian:
$$H = -J\sum_{i=1}^{3}\sigma_i^z\sigma_{i+1}^z$$
where $$J > 0$$ and $$\sigma^z$$ is the Pauli matrix.

#### Properties:
1. **Ground State**: $$|\psi_0\rangle = |\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow\rangle$$ or $$|\downarrow\downarrow\downarrow\downarrow\rangle$$
2. **Energy Gap**: $$\Delta = 2J$$ (to flip any single spin)
3. **Entanglement**: For any bipartition, the entanglement entropy $$S = 0$$ because the ground state is separable.

#### Why Low Entanglement?
- The gap $$\Delta$$ prevents long-range quantum correlations
- Local perturbations cannot generate extensive entanglement
- Satisfies the 1D area law: $$S \leq \text{constant}$$ independent of system size

This demonstrates how gapped 1D systems naturally suppress entanglement growth.
