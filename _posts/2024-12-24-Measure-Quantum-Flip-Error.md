In quantum computing, a sign change corresponds to a phase flip error. To measure or detect such an error, we use **quantum error correction codes** that are designed to handle phase flip errors (as well as other types like bit flips).

### Key Techniques for Measuring a Sign Change (Phase Flip)

1. **Parity Check with Ancilla Qubits**:
   - Ancilla (helper) qubits are used to interact with the data qubits via carefully designed circuits.
   - Parity checks are performed to detect the presence of a phase flip (without collapsing the quantum state).

2. **Phase Flip Error Detection Codes**:
   - **Shor Code**: Encodes a single logical qubit into nine physical qubits to detect and correct both bit flips and phase flips. For phase flips:
     - A Hadamard gate is applied to all qubits to convert phase flips into bit flips in the computational basis.
     - Error syndromes are measured using ancilla qubits to detect discrepancies.
   - **Steane Code**: A more compact error-correcting code that uses 7 qubits to handle both bit and phase flip errors.

3. **Stabilizer Formalism**:
   - Stabilizer codes like the **[7, 1, 3] code** work by measuring operators (Pauli matrices, e.g., $$ Z $$ or $$ X $$) that commute with the encoded state but detect phase errors.
   - A phase flip introduces a detectable eigenvalue change in specific stabilizers, allowing the error to be identified.

4. **Using Hadamard Gates**:
  A phase flip ($$ |0\rangle \to |0\rangle, |1\rangle \to -|1\rangle $$) can be converted to a bit flip ($$ |0\rangle \to |1\rangle, |1\rangle \to |0\rangle $$) by applying a Hadamard gate before and after the operation:
     \[
     H Z H = X
     \]
   - This conversion makes phase flips detectable using similar methods as bit flips.

### Measuring the Error
Once detected, the error is corrected by applying the appropriate recovery operation (e.g., a $$ Z $$-gate for a phase flip). Direct measurement of the error is avoided because it could collapse the quantum state, so the process relies on ancillary systems and indirect measurement techniques.
